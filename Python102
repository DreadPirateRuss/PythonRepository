# This section will focus on statements, loops, and ranges. 
# After learning the basic data types, the next steps focus on working and manipulating the different data types.
# If statements are great. They let us evaluate whether statements are true. When used with loops it allows even more powerful operations.
# If statements can be simple or complex. They can also be nested creating more analytical statements.
# simple if statement
if 10 > 5:
    print("Number greater than 5")
print("Ending program.")

# if statement output
Number greater than 5
Ending program.
>>> 

# adjusted if statement
if 4 > 5:
    print("Number greater than 5")
print("Ending program.")
# adjusted if statement output
Ending program.
>>> 

# An else statement follows and if statement. This allows additional conditions to be applied.
# if/else statement
x = 6
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
else:
    print("x is greater than 5")
    
# if/else statement output
x is greater than 5
>>> 

# else statements can include if statements to add more possibilities.
# multiple if/else statements
x = 6
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")

    if x > 5:

            print("x is equal to 5")
        else:
            print("x is not a number")

# multiple if/else statements output
x is greater than 5
>>> 

# for the sake of simplicity, there is a condensed version of the if/else statement, elif.
