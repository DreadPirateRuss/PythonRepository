# This section will focus on statements, loops, and ranges. 
# After learning the basic data types, the next steps focus on working and manipulating the different data types.
# If statements are great. They let us evaluate whether statements are true. When used with loops it allows even more powerful operations.
# If statements can be simple or complex. They can also be nested creating more analytical statements.
# simple if statement
if 10 > 5:
    print("Number greater than 5")
print("Ending program.")

# if statement output
Number greater than 5
Ending program.
>>> 

# adjusted if statement
if 4 > 5:
    print("Number greater than 5")
print("Ending program.")
# adjusted if statement output
Ending program.
>>> 

# An else statement follows and if statement. This allows additional conditions to be applied.

# if/else statement
x = 6
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
else:
    print("x is greater than 5")
    
# if/else statement output
x is greater than 5
>>> 

# else statements can include if statements to add more possibilities.
# multiple if/else statements
x = 6
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
else:
    if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")
    else:
        if x == 5:
            print("x is equal to 5")
        else:
            print("x is not a number")

# multiple if/else statements output
x is greater than 5
>>> 

# for the sake of simplicity, there is a condensed version of the if/else statement, elif.
x = 6
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is not a number")

# elif statement output
x is greater than 5

# Lists

# Ranges


# Conditional statements such as if, else, and elif allow us to manipulate data. Loops do as well and there is a difference between them.
# A 'for' and 'while' loop do the same thing, loop through a function until completion.
# A 'while' loop is different as the number of iterations does not need to be known, can be more flexible, and can contain
# more complicated functions. This makes a while loop more flexible and general.
# A 'for' loop is better when the number of iterations are known, loop is applied to a range, and is more secure when handling variables.
# Knowing the number of iterations is the key in deciding which loop to use.

# simple 'while' loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
print("finished")


# simple 'while' loop output
1
2
3
4
5
finished
>>> 

# a simple 'for' loop
words = ["Keep","It","Simple","Stupid"]
for word in words:
    print(word + "!")

# simple 'for' loop output
Keep!
It!
Simple!
Stupid!
>>> 

# Both loops run though and print their respective outputs. I will include a 'while' loop for the last example to show how knowing
# the number of iterations is key in the loop.

# simple 'while' loop using a list
# variables
words = ["Keep","It","Simple","Stupid"]
y = 0
x = len(words)-1

while y <= x:
    word = words[y]
    print(word + "!")
    y = y + 1

# simple 'while' loop using a list output
Keep!
It!
Simple!
Stupid!
>>> 

# As we see, using a 'while' loop is much more clunky when working with a 'list'. A counter variable (variables x and y) has 
# to be included so there is something for the 'while' loop to count against. 
# (This is a rough description, but the concept is the important part)
