# This section will focus on statements, loops, and ranges. 
# After learning the basic data types, the next steps focus on working and manipulating the different data types.
# If statements are great. They let us evaluate whether statements are true. When used with loops it allows even more powerful operations.
# If statements can be simple or complex. They can also be nested creating more analytical statements.
# simple if statement
if 10 > 5:
    print("Number greater than 5")
print("Ending program.")

# if statement output
Number greater than 5
Ending program.
>>> 

# adjusted if statement
if 4 > 5:
    print("Number greater than 5")
print("Ending program.")
# adjusted if statement output
Ending program.

# An else statement follows and if statement. This allows additional conditions to be applied.

# if/else statement
x = 6
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
else:
    print("x is greater than 5")
    
# if/else statement output

# else statements can include if statements to add more possibilities.
# multiple if/else statements

        else:
            print("x is not a number")

# multiple if/else statements output
x is greater than 5

# for the sake of simplicity, there is a condensed version of the if/else statement, elif.

# 'Lists' are just like they sound, an indexed list of items. 'Lists' are created using the square brackets '[]'. 
# 'Lists' can be created empty, and data put into it later. 'lists' can also include another list (nested list).
# Specific parts in a 'list' are accesed using the item's index within the list i.e. index [2] is item 2.
# Avoid indexing without a 'list'

# Two simple 'list' examples
words = ["Keep","It","Simple","Stupid"]
print(words)
print(words[0])
print(words[1])
print(words[2])
print(words[3])

# A simple 'list' example output
['Keep', 'It', 'Simple', 'Stupid']
Keep
It
Simple
Stupid
>>> 

# It is also possible to call a 'list' inside a 'list' a.k.a. nested 'list'
# A simple nested 'list'
words = ["Keep","It","Simple",["Or","At","Least","Try"],"Stupid"]
print(words[0])
print(words[1])
print(words[2])
print(words[4])
print(words[3][0])
print(words[3][1])
print(words[3][2])
print(words[3][3])
>>> 

# A simple nested 'list' output
Keep
It
Simple
Stupid
Or
At
Least
Try
>>> 

# for simplicity and reduction of text vertically, multiple arguments can be put into one statement. 
# 'List' with multiple arguments in a single statement
words = ["Keep","It","Simple",["Or","At","Least","Try"],"Stupid"]
print(words[0],words[1],words[2],words[4])

# 'List' with multiple arguments in a single text output
Keep It Simple Stupid
>>> 

# 'Range' creates a sequential list of numbers. These can be in any interval and between any two numbers. The numbers must be integers.
# A 'range' creates a range object that has to be converted to a list if it is to be used.
# A 'range' only creates an object from the first argument up to the second argument.
# A 'range' must be assigned to a list. If it is not, the print function will only print the data about the range.


# This shows how a 'range' creates from the first up to the second argument (but not including)

# A simple 'range' of numbers
num = list(range(1,20))
print(num)
# A simple 'range' of numbers output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
>>> 

# A 'range' of numbers
num = range(1,20)
print(num)
# Output of a 'range' of numbers
range(1, 20)
>>> 

# If the 'range' is assigned to a list, the numbers become clearer
num = list(range(1,20,2))
print(num)
# Output
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]

# Conditional statements such as if, else, and elif allow us to manipulate data. Loops do as well and there is a difference between them.
# A 'for' and 'while' loop do the same thing, loop through a function until completion.
# A 'while' loop is different as the number of iterations does not need to be known, can be more flexible, and can contain
# more complicated functions. This makes a while loop more flexible and general.
# A 'for' loop is better when the number of iterations are known, loop is applied to a range, and is more secure when handling variables.
# Knowing the number of iterations is the key in deciding which loop to use.

# simple 'while' loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
print("finished")


# simple 'while' loop output
1
2
3
4
5
finished
>>> 

# a simple 'for' loop
words = ["Keep","It","Simple","Stupid"]
for word in words:
    print(word + "!")

# simple 'for' loop output
Keep!
It!
Simple!
Stupid!
>>> 

# Both loops run though and print their respective outputs. I will include a 'while' loop for the last example to show how knowing
# the number of iterations is key in the loop.

# simple 'while' loop using a list
# variables
words = ["Keep","It","Simple","Stupid"]
y = 0
x = len(words)-1

while y <= x:
    word = words[y]
    print(word + "!")
    y = y + 1

# simple 'while' loop using a list output
Keep!
It!
Simple!
Stupid!
>>> 

# As we see, using a 'while' loop is much more clunky when working with a 'list'. A counter variable (variables x and y) has 
# to be included so there is something for the 'while' loop to count against. 
# (This is a rough description, but the concept is the important part)
