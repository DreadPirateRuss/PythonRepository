# This section will focus on statements, loops, and ranges. 
# After learning the basic data types, the next steps focus on working and manipulating the different data types.
# If statements are great. They let us evaluate whether statements are true. When used with loops it allows even more powerful operations.
# If statements can be simple or complex. They can also be nested creating more analytical statements.

# if statement output
