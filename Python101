## Python 3.6.#
## Online Compiler: https://repl.it/languages/python3
## This module will include examples of data types and operators
## Modulce includes variable assignments and type conversions

# Printing a simple statement. Double quotes and single quotes yield same result in this case.
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
>>> print('Hello World!')
Hello World!

# Doing simple operations. This includes manipulating strings and numbers and can happen without a 'print' statement.
# Multiplication(*), Division(//), Addition(+), and Subtraction(-).
>>> 2*6
12
>>> 12//2
6
>>> 7+5
12
>>> 9-5
4

# Division equations produce a float number if using one forward slash. This is because the the other equations will always 
# yield an integer. but dividing an integer by another may not always produce an integer as shown in the these examples.
>>> 11//3
3
>>> 11/3
3.666666666666666
   
# Separate different steps in the equation with parentheses.
>>> 2*6+5
17
>>> 2*(6+5)
22

# Floats are the numbers which are not integers. They are followed by a decimal with a number after.
# Python will change an integer into a float, but this is the only type conversion it does on its own.

# Statement of assumptions.This is where I will state things that I assume a person already knows.
# 1 - You cannot divide by zero(0). In Python it will create a 'ZeroDivisionError'
