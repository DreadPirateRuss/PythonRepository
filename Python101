## Python 3.6.#
## Online Compiler: https://repl.it/languages/python3
## This module will include examples of data types and operators
## Modulce includes variable assignments and type conversions

# Printing a simple statement. Double quotes and single quotes yield same result in this case.
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
>>> print('Hello World!')
Hello World!

# Doing simple operations. This includes manipulating strings and numbers and can happen without a 'print' statement.
# Multiplication(*), Division(/), Addition(+), and Subtraction(-). Division equations produce a float number.
>>> 2*6
12
>>> 12/2
6.0
>>> 7+5
12
>>> 9-5
4

# Separate different steps in the equation with parentheses.
>>> 2*6+5
17
>>> 2*(6+5)
22

# Floats are the numbers which are not integers. They are followed by a decimal with a number after.
# Python will change an integer into a float, but this is the only type conversion it does on its own.
