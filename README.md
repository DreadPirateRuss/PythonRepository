# PythonRepository
Python programming 

# Statement of assumptions i.e. things people should already know.
1 - You cannot divide by zero(0)...ever! In Python it will create a 'ZeroDivisionError'
2 - How to assign variables and that there are different data types.
3 - How to use an editor or compiler.
4 - Counting starts with zero(0) not one(1).

# WET/DRY Concept
D.R.Y. = Don't Repeat Yourself. Code will be reused throughout programs and if code will be reused, then try to write it into a function rather than rewriting it. 
A simple example would be if your program is going to add 2 variables ex. (a + b), write a fucntion with input variables, rather than writing the same code again.
W.E.T = Write Everything Twice or We Enjoy Typing. This means if you enjoy typing code twice, then swing for the fences!
